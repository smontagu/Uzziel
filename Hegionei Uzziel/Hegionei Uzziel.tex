\chapter{Creation of the World}

Praised be the Creator and exalted the Maker, who created his world in wisdom and made Man, the crown of creation, in his image, as it is written, “In the beginning God created.”\footnote{Genesis 1:1.} The ancient Aramaic translation, the Targum Yerushalmi, translates this verse, “In wisdom God created,” and the implicit message of this translation is stated explicitly in the Zohar: “Rabbi Yehudai said, what is ‘in the beginning’? This is the wisdom on which the world stands, the path leading to sublime and secret mysteries”.\footnote{Introduction to the Zohar 3b.} “What is ‘the beginning’? This is wisdom, this is the point within, about which it is said, ‘All glorious is the king's daughter within;’\footnote{Psalm 45:14.} this is the fear which is the first commandment, concerning which it is written, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.’\footnote{Proverbs 1:74}''\footnote{Tikkunei Hazohar, Tikun 30.} King David wrote similarly in the Psalms: “O Lord, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all.”\footnote{Psalm 104:24.}

The knowledge of this wisdom, in so far as human beings can achieve it, is the source of love and awe for He who created the world and sustains it, as Maimonides writes in his halachic code, “When a person considers these things and and is aware of all created beings from the angels and the heavenly spheres to human beings and others, and sees the wisdom of the Holy One, Blessed be He, in all the beings he created and formed, his love for God will increase; his soul will thirst and his body will yearn to love God, Blessed be He. He will be in fear and awe on account of his lowliness, his worthlessness, and his insignificance … he will see himself as a poor and shameful object, empty and lacking.\footnote{Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah, 2:2, 4:12.}

This is exactly the same idea that we quoted from the \textit{Tikkunei Zohar}: “This is wisdom … this is awe … of which is written, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.’”

This is a fundamental principle for the perfection of the world, and the wisest of all men summed it up in a few short words: “I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God hath so made it, that men should fear before Him.”\footnote{Ecclesiastes 3:14.} Rabbi Yehuda said, ``God made the world only so that he should be feared, as is is written, `God hath so made it, that men should fear before Him.’”\footnote{B. Shabbat 31a.} Maimonides interpreted this verse as referring to the eternity of the world and the renewal of its wonders: “He declares in these words that the world has been created by God and remains for ever. He adds the reason for it by saying, ‘Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it:’ for this is the reason for the perpetuity, as if he meant to say that things are changed in order to supply that which is wanting, or in order to take away what is superfluous. The works of God being most perfect, admitting no addition or deduction, must remain the same for ever … In the conclusion of the verse, Solomon, as it were describes the purpose of exceptions from the laws of Nature, or an excuse for changes in them, when he says, ‘And God doeth it (viz., He performs miracles) that men should fear before him.’”\footnote{Guide to the Perplexed 2:25, trsl. Friedlander.}

Maimonides means that changes from the natural course of nature take place so that people will believe that they are God’s handiwork and are like clay in the hands of a potter who can do whatever he wishes with the world and everything in it, and so that they will be in awe of Him.\footnote{Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera’s commentary ad loc.} This is all summed up in the saying of Rabbi Yehuda, “God only created his world,” i.e. the nature of the world and the miraculous renewal in it are his world, which God created in eternity and in wonderful variety, “so that the work of his hands should be in awe of him.” From this we learn that the the world was created in general and in all its details in wisdom with the intention of perfecting human beings, who were created in with amazing wisdom unlike ever other creature, in order to make them wise and intelligent with awe and love for God. This is the only true wisdom, from which all other branches of knowledge spring like branches from the trunk. They are all descendants and subdivisions of it, as the Rabbis said, “God has nothing in his world but awe of Heaven, as it is written, ‘And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God demand of you except to be in awe,” and it is written, ‘And he said to the man “Behold [\textit{Hen}]”’ — fear of God is wisdom, since ‘\textit{Hen}’ is Greek for ‘one’”.\footnote{B. Shabbat 31b.}

\chapter{The Creation of the Human Race}

The creation of the human race comes at the end of the story of creation, since it unified all created beings. All visible and concealed forces in creation are dead bodies waiting for human action to discover them and activate them. What is more, human beings have a special power which even angels do not posess: the image of God on their face, as the verse says, “God created Man in his own image.” The rabbis commented on this verse, “Beloved is Man who was created in God’s image, but a special love was shown when it was revealed to him that he was Created in God’s image\footnote{Avot 3:14}.

In other words, the human race is more favoured than all creation since it was created in the divine image, and a special favour was made known to man when he was told that he was created in the divine image. As Maimonides writes, “Making known the extent to which we are favoured is a separate favour. Sometimes someone is granted a favour out of pity, and this is done in secret so as not to shame him,\footnote{Commentary to the Mishnah ad loc.} Rabbenu Yonah also writes, “Man would have been favoured by being created in the divine image even if it had not been made known to him that he was created in the divine image, but he was favoured after being created in God’s image when we were informed of this it was an extra favour\footnote{ibid.}

\chapter{The Image of God}

``And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him.'' This verse does not specify what ``the image of God'' means, and this has caused error among the ignorant, who lack the image of God and are unaware of His presence within themselves. They punctuate the verse incorrectly and read it, ``In the image, God created him'', as if God created man in the image. Ibn Ezra rejected this incorrect and misleading interpretation\footnote{Genesis 1:27}. Rashi also wrote ``God showed special favour by creating humans in his image ... and anyone who distorts the meaning by saying that he was created in the image is guilty of heresy.\footnote{Avot \textit{loc. cit}}

Ibn Ezra continues, ``[Sa`adia] Ga'on interprets `in our image, in our likeness' as `ruling,' by which he means in the image that He saw in wisdom as being good, and for the honour of the human race this was attributed to God.'' In other words, Sa`adia Gaon's interpretation of the verse is that man was created in the image that God saw as good, and ``in God's image'' means in the image of greatness of honour, as in the verses ``they went out of His land'',\footnote{Ezekiel 36:20} and ``The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof.''\footnote{Psalm 24:1}

This should never have been written: Ibn Ezra is putting a false interpretation into Sa`adia's mouth. Here is what Sa`adia actually wrote, translated from the Arabic: ``God created man in his image, He created him as a ruler.'' That is, the image of God in man is the image of rulership, just as the word \textit{elohim} in Hebrew means both ``God'' and ``judges,'' as in the verses ``the owner of the house shall approach \textit{elohim},''\footnote{Exodus 22:7} ``the cause of both parties shall come before \textit{elohim}; he whom \textit{elohim} condemn,''\footnote{\textit{ibid} 8} and ``Thou shalt not  curse \textit{elohim}.''\footnote{\textit{ibid} 27}. Sa`adia also translates ``The sons of \textit{elohim} saw the daughters of men''\footnote{Genesis 6:2} as ``the sons of the powerful,'' which is similar to Onkelos' Aramaic translation and Rashi's commentary ``The sons of the rulers and the judges.''

So when he writes ``He created him as a ruler,'' he means that ``in His image'' means that the image of man is the image of rule and domination, which is called ``the image of \textit{elohim}, and this is also the image of God as it is revealed to us in his omnipotent power. This is clear because Sa`adia did not write ``God created him as a ruler.''
