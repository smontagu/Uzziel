== The Creation of the World


Praised be the Creator and exalted be the Maker, who created his world
with wisdom and made Man, the crown of creation, in his image, as it
is written, "_Bereshit bara Elohim_" — "In the beginning God
created…"#footnote[Genesis 1:1.] The Aramaic translation known as the
Targum Yerushalmi translates this verse, "With wisdom God created,"
and the message hiding between the lines of this translation is stated
explicitly by the holy Zohar: "Rabbi Yehudai said, 'what is "_Reshit_"?
It is the wisdom by which the world is supported, leading
into sublime and secret mysteries'".#footnote[Introduction to the Zohar
3b.] "What is '_Reshit_'? It is wisdom, the innermost point
about which the Psalm says, 'All glorious is the king's daughter
within'.#footnote[Psalm 45:14.] It is the awe which is the first
commandment, concerning which the book of Proverbs says,
'The awe of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.'#footnote[Proverbs
1:74]"#footnote[_Tikkunei Hazohar_, _Tikkun_ 30.] King David wrote
similarly in the Psalms: "O Lord, how manifold are Your works! In
wisdom you have made them all."#footnote[Psalm 104:24.]

Knowledge of this wisdom, in so far as a human being can attain it, acts as the cause
of love and awe for He who created the world and sustains it, as Maimonides
writes in his halachic code, "When a person considers these things, and is aware
of all created beings from the angels and the heavenly spheres to human beings
and others, and perceives the wisdom of the Holy One, Blessed be He, in all the
beings he created and formed, his love for God will increase; his soul will
thirst and his body will yearn to love God, Blessed be He. He will be in fear
and in awe due to his lowliness, his worthlessness, and his insignificance … he
will see himself as a wretched and shameful object, empty and
lacking.#footnote[_Mishneh Torah_, _Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah_, 2:2, 4:12.]

This is exactly the same idea as that expressed by the _Tikkunei Zohar_: "This
is wisdom … this is awe … concerning which it is written, 'The fear of the Lord
is the beginning of knowledge.'"

This is one of the cornerstones of the world's progress towards perfection, and
King Solomon, the wisest of all men, summed it up in a few short words: "I know
that whatever God makes, shall last for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor
any thing taken away from it; and God has made it, so that men should be in awe
of Him."#footnote[Ecclesiastes 3:14.] Ribbi Yehuda said, "God created the world
only so that he should be held in awe, as is is written, 'God has made it, so
that men should be in awe of Him.'"#footnote[bShabbat 31a.] Maimonides
interpreted this verse as referring to the eternity of the world and the renewal
of its wonders: "He declares in these words that the world has been created by
God and remains for ever. He adds the reason for it by saying, 'Nothing can be
put to it, nor anything taken from it:' for this is the reason for the
perpetuity, as if he meant to say that things are changed in order to supply
that which is wanting, or in order to take away what is superfluous. The works
of God being most perfect, admitting no addition or deduction, must remain the
same for ever. It is impossible that anything should exist that could cause a
change in them. In the conclusion of the verse, Solomon, as it were describes
the purpose of exceptions from the laws of Nature, or an excuse for changes in
them, when he says, 'And God doeth it (viz., He performs miracles) that men
should fear before him.'"#footnote[Guide to the Perplexed 2:28, trsl.
Friedlander.]

Maimonides means that when things happen outside the laws of nature,
the reason for it is to make people believe that they are God's
creation, and are like clay in the hands of a potter who can do
whatever he wishes with the world and everything it contains, and so
that they will be in awe of Him.#footnote[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera's
commentary _ad loc._] All of this is summed up in Ribbi Yehuda's
statement that "God only created His world," i.e. the laws of nature
and the miracles constantly present in it are God's world, which He
created to include both permanence and wonderful variety, "so that the
work of his hands should be in awe of him." From this we learn that
the world, as a whole and in all its details, was created through
wisdom, and its objective is the perfection of human beings, who were
created possessing marvellous wisdom possessed by no other creature,
in order that they might attain wisdom and knowledge together with awe
and love for God. That is the only true wisdom, from which all other
branches of knowledge spring like branches from the trunk. They are
all descendants and subdivisions of it, as the Rabbis said, "God has
nothing in his world but the awe of Heaven, as it is written, 'And now,
Israel, what does the Lord your God demand of you except to be in
awe,' and it is written, 'And he said to Adam "Behold [_Hen_] — fear
of God is wisdom',#footnote[Job 28:28.] since '_Hen_' is Greek for
'one'."#footnote[bShabbat 31b.]

== The Creation of the Human Race

The creation of the human race was the final stage of creation, since it unified all created beings. All of the visible and concealed forces in creation are dead bodies waiting for human action to discover them and activate them. What is more, human beings have a special power which is not shared even by the angels: the image of God, as the verse says, "God created Man in his own image." The rabbis commented on this verse, "Beloved is Man who was created in God's image, but a special love was shown when it was revealed to him that he was created in God's image."#footnote[Avot 3:14]

In other words, the human race is more favoured than all creation since it was created in the divine image, and a special favour was made known to man when he was told that he was created in the divine image. As Maimonides writes, "Making known the extent to which we are favoured is a favour in its own right. Sometimes someone is granted a favour out of pity, and this is done discreetly so that he should not feel ashamed.#footnote[Commentary to the Mishna _ad loc_.] Rabbenu Yonah also writes, "Man would have been favoured by being created in the divine image even if it had not been made known to him that he was created in the divine image, but he was favoured after being created in God's image and granted the additional favour of being told of this."#footnote[ibid.]

== The Image of God

"And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him." This verse does not specify what "the image of God" means, and this has caused error among the ignorant, who lack the image of God and are unaware of His presence within themselves. They punctuate the verse incorrectly and read it, "In the image, God created him", as if God created man in the image. Ibn Ezra rejected this incorrect and misleading interpretation.#footnote[Genesis 1:27] Rashi also wrote "God showed special favour by creating humans in his image ... and anyone who distorts the meaning by saying that he was created in the image is guilty of misbelief.#footnote[Avot _loc. cit_.]

Ibn Ezra continues, "[Sa‘adia] Ga'on interprets 'in our image, in our likeness' as 'ruling,' by which he means in the image that He saw in wisdom as being good, and for the honour of the human race this was attributed to God." In other words, Sa‘adia Gaon's interpretation of the verse is that man was created in the image that God saw as good, and "in God's image" means in the image of greatness of honour, as in the verses "they went out of His land",#footnote[Ezekiel 36:20] and "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof."#footnote[Psalm 24:1]

This should never have been written: Ibn Ezra is putting a false interpretation into Sa‘adia's mouth. Here is what Sa‘adia actually wrote, translated from the Arabic: "God created man in his image, He created him as a ruler." That is, the image of God in man is the image of rulership, just as the word _elohim_ in Hebrew means both "God" and "judges," as in the verses "the owner of the house shall approach _elohim_,"#footnote[Exodus 22:7] "the cause of both parties shall come before _elohim_; he whom _elohim_ condemn,"#footnote[_ibid 8_] and "Thou shalt not  curse _elohim_."#footnote[_ibid 27_]. Sa‘adia also translates "The sons of _elohim_ saw the daughters of men"#footnote[Genesis 6:2] as "the sons of the powerful," which is similar to Onkelos' Aramaic translation and Rashi's commentary "The sons of the rulers and the judges."

So when he writes "He created him as a ruler," he means that "in His image" means that the image of man is the image of rule and domination, which is called "the image of _elohim_, and this is also the image of God as it is revealed to us in his omnipotent power. This is clear because Sa\`adia did not write "God created him as a ruler."
